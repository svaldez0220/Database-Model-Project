# Database-Model-Project

Team Members: Denise Bishi, Mia Brown, Connor Knowles & Santos Valdez

This project emulates the IMDb Database. The Relational Schema Diagram models the necessary entities and attributes needed to provide the required functionality of the Database. The code creates the database in Oracle, and the report outlines depictions of the database, as well as meaningful queries performed upon the data.
